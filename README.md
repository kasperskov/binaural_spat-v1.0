### About
binaural_spat is a collection of Max for Live devices for binaural spatialisation in Ableton Live using IRCAM's Spat5 library. binaural_spat makes use of new multichannel routing capabilities in Live 10 and Max for Live. Before continuing, make sure to have both installed. 

The current version is still being tested, so if you encounter any issues on Windows or Mac, please report back to me. 
### Installation
When you clone the repository, make sure to leave the Max for Live devices in the downloaded folder. This ensures that other included files (i.e. 3D head model) gets loaded correctly when setting up a Live Set.
